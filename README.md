# Facebook Server Side Authentication Flow using Facebook C# SDK with ASP.NET MVC3
This sample demonstrates the use of server side Facebook authentication in ASP.NET MVC3 using Facebook C# SDK v6.

_Note: This sample does not necessarily demonstrate the best use but rather sample on using Facebook C# SDK on the server side auth flow. It is highly recommended to use a mixture of both Facebook Javascript SDK and Facebook C# SDK for best performance rather than using your ASP.NET MVC3 app as a proxy to Facebook server._

# Getting started

Set the appropriate AppId and AppSecret before running the sample.

```csharp
private const string AppId = "app_id";
private const string Appsecret = "app_secret";
```
